# Principles of MLOps
Transition friction, Version Control, Performance, Automation, Monitoring, Continuous training 
# MLflow
Open Source platform to mainatain end to end machine learning life cycle. 
# MLFlow components
## Tracking - Track expreriments to record and compare parameters and results
## Projects - Packaage code to ensure reusability and reproducibility
## Model - Provides standard unit for packaging models
## Registry - Central model store for model versioning stage tarnsitions, annotations

# set_tracking uri() 
## set the default tracking uri for current run
## we can be empty string, will create then "mlruns" folder
## we can provide name folder 
## we can provide file path -> but only works for C drive 
## we can provide remote path
## we can provide databricks workspace

# get_tracking uri()
## gives only output 

# create_experiment()
## to create new experiment
## can provide name of the experiment
## can provide artifact_location paramater -> 
## can provide tags as dictionary of key value pairs for future usage
## return the string id 

# set_experiment()
## set already created experiment
